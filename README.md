# Vehicle-Counter-System-using-Opencv
This project is made with an inspiration to provide solution for traffic planning. The project utilizes opencv and detects the vehicles passing on the road and count them via a video input. This technique can be used to analyze the traffic at different times on any road and helps in making useful decisions such as traffic signal wait time etc. 



**Introduction:**

Vehicle counting is a process of identifying and tracking the movement of vehicles in a particular area, and counting the number of vehicles passing through that area within a given time frame. This process is often used in traffic management and transportation planning to gather data on the volume of traffic in a particular location.

**Problem Statement:**

The lack of accurate and up-to-date data on vehicle traffic patterns is a very vital problem.Traditional methods of gathering this data, such as manual counts or loop detectors embedded in the roadway, can be time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to error.The problem requires a system that can accurately count the number of vehicles passing through a certain location. This is important for traffic management and analysis, as it allows us to understand the volume of traffic at a given location and make informed decisions about infrastructure and planning. The system should be able to accurately count vehicles in time, without the need for manual intervention.

**Objective:**

To develop a reliable and efficient system for automatically counting vehicles as they pass through a specific area or along a roadway, in order to gather data on vehicle traffic patterns and improve transportation planning, traffic management, and road safety.
**Proposed Solution:**
One way to perform vehicle counting is through the use of computer vision techniques, which involve using cameras and machine learning algorithms to analyze video footage and identify and track individual vehicles. This can be done using Python, a popular programming language that is well-suited for image and video processing tasks. With the right tools and techniques, it is possible to develop a vehicle counting system that is accurate, reliable, and scalable. Overall, a vehicle counter system is a useful tool for gathering data on vehicle traffic patterns , which can be used to improve transportation planning, traffic management, and road safety. To count vehicles, we will first use OpenCV to detect the vehicles in the video feed. This can be done using a combination of image processing techniques such as edge detection, color filtering, and shape analysis.
