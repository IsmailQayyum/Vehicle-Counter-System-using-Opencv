# Vehicle-Counter-System-using-Opencv
This project is made with an inspiration to provide solution for traffic planning. The project utilizes opencv and detects the vehicles passing on the road and count them via a video input. This technique can be used to analyze the traffic at different times on any road and helps in making useful decisions such as traffic signal wait time etc.
